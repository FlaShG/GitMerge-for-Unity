    <h1>Using Unity with Git, made painless for everyone.</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        <i>GitMerge for Unity</i> is a free, open source Unity Editor tool that allows you
        to merge scene and prefab files. This solves the main problem you currently get when using
        Git to work with Unity.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>
            Unity offers a few solutions for collaborative teamwork. These do not necessarily stick to
            the standard you're used to. So... <b>why not use Git?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll have to take these two things into account in order to get started:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Setup a good .gitignore, like
                    <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore" target="_blank">
                        this one</a>.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Get yourself a mergetool for scenes and prefabs.<br />
                    That's where <i>GitMerge for Unity</i> is supposed to come in.
                </li>
            </ol>

    <h2 id="install">How to Install</h2>
    <h3>Recommended: Use Unity's package manager</h3>
    <p>
        The recommended way to install <i>GitMerge for Unity</i> is to copy the git url and paste it into the package manager.<br />

    <h3>Alternative: Clone into Assets</h3>
    <p>
        Alternatively, just clone the repository into your Assets Folder.

        <i>GitMerge for Unity</i> is an open source software and is constantly being developed.
        If you find something that could be improved, please feel free to help!
    </div>
    <h3 id="instructions-start" class="clear">Start merging</h3>
    <p>
        <i>GitMerge for Unity</i> comes as an opt-in merge tool.
        It is not integrated into Git as an automatic merge tool since merging scenes and prefabs
        is something you'd usually not want to have done automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        First off, you create your merge conflict the way you usually do.
        Once you're in Git's MERGING state, open the GitMerge window in Unity (Window &rarr; GitMerge).
        Then, drag the scene or prefab you want to merge and drop it into the big box.
    </p>
    
    <div class="pull-right with-margin panel panel-default small-text" style="width:530px">
        <div class="panel-body">
            <img src="SceneMergeScreen.jpg" />
            <p>
                This is what a scene merge situation can look like.
            </p>
            <p class="last">
                The BoxCollider component of the "Cube" GameObject has been automatically merged to the default setting ("keep it").<br />
                The user has decided to use "their" version of Transform.LocalPosition, but "our" version of Rigidbody.Interpolate and BoxCollider.IsTrigger.<br />
                The other two conflicts have not been addressed yet.
            </p>
       </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Solving Merge Conflicts</h3>
    <p>
        The tool will find the differences between the "our" and "their" version of the scene/prefab.
        You will get a list of so called "MergeActions" in the tool window.
        Each MergeAction solves one point of conflict between the two scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
        To do solve the conflict bit by bit, you will be offered two to three options for each MergeAction:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Use "ours"</b> (left side)</li>
            <li><b>Use "theirs"</b> (right side)</li>
            <li><b>Use new</b> (center, when applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        You can choose to click the left button to use "our" version, the right button for "their" version,
        or enter a new value in the middle. Either way, the MergeAction line will turn from red (unmerged)
        to green (merged).
        MergeActions that have been automatically merged to a default
        (like keeping a Component that "their" version doesn't have) are marked yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can continue to edit the scene in a normal way during merging.
        It is not recommended to delete GameObjects that might be part of a MergeAction though.
        Consider merging first, and apply changes to the GameObject hierarchy afterwards for a new commit.
    </p>
    <p>
        When all MergeActions are flagged as merged, you can click on "Apply merge".<br />
        The scene will be saved and marked as merged for git. Since there could be more merge conflicts,
        the button will not automatically create a commit.<br />
        You'll have to commit your merge manually at some later point.
    </p>
